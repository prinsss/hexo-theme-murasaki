# Murasaki

Yet another minimalist theme for Hexo.

WARNING: THIS PROJECT IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT STAGE.

## Installation

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/printempw/hexo-theme-murasaki themes/murasaki
```

Set theme to `murasaki` to enable.

## Config

Editing `_config.yml` in theme folder directly is not recommended.

Instead, configure it in your site's `_config.yml`:

```yml
# Hexo's main config file
theme_config:
  favicon: /images/favicon.png
  # etc.
```

## Thanks

This theme is greatly inspired by [Typecho's default theme](https://github.com/typecho/typecho/tree/master/usr/themes/default) and [NexT](https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next).
